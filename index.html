			<h1>Welcome to the Doggie Playdate Matching Service</h1>
			<p>Does your doggie companion need a friend? Are you uncomfortable taking Fido to the dog park because of rough-playing dogs? Doggie Dates has the solution!</p>
			<p>Doggie Dates will match your dog with another canine in your area for structured playdates. Whether it's going for a hike, romping at the beach, or soaking up some rays, your dog will enjoy time spent with a well-behaved canine companion.</p>
			<p>How does it work? Doggie Dates collects a complete profile of your dog, including a visit by a professional dog handler, to assess their energy and identify activities your dog enjoys. Our trained staff then match your dog with another based on their profiles. For the first playdate, one of Doggie Dates' professional handlers will accompany the dogs to ensure that the dogs are a good fit and to assist the owners in helping the dogs to be as comfortable as possible.</p>
